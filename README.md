# math
It's more like a review of math I've learnt in college. But aims at helping one of my friend, with no concept about Calculus, Linear Algebra Probability and Statistics at all, majoring in linguistics, with his math.

## Plan
update 3 times a week.
- [x] overview
- [x] 0101 in computers(How does computer work)
- [ ] Proofs sequences logic and graphs(Discrete mathematics)
- [ ] Wave-particle duality(Calculus)
- [ ] Non-negative Matrix Factorization(Linear algebra)
- [ ] Information theory(Probability)
- [ ] Blockchain(HashTree and Cryptography)
- [ ] Recommendations clustering search ranking and document filtering(Thoughts)
- [ ] Natural language understanding and Digital image processing(Combined)


## 1st week Review
I find it a hard way to let my friend foucs on what I'm talking about. It looks like so boring just as when I learned math. Thanks to Mr.Shizhong, one of my favorate professor, once teached "Computer Networking", impressed me. I'd like to use his way to finish this study.

## 2nd week Review
this week, we finished an overview. It's interesting during the day. And I think this course or what we want is to get the concepts and applications of math rather than calculation.
