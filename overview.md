# Overview

Let's take a quick view of what we've learnt.
- function
- limits
- applications of math

Well, that's not cool enough. What I want is to give you some ideas about things below:
- 0101 in computers(How does computers work)
- Proofs sequences logic and graphs(Discrete mathematics)
- Wave-particle duality(Calculus)
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization(Linear algebra)
- Information theory(Probability)
- Blockchain(HashTree and Cryptography)
- Recommendations clustering search ranking and document filtering(Thoughts)
- Natural language understanding and Digital image processing(Combined)

First of all, you should know some "fundamental concepts".
