# math
It's more like a review of math I've learnt in college. But aims at helping one of my friend, with no concept about Calculus, Linear Algebra Probability and Statistics at all, majoring in linguistics, with his math.

## Plan
update 3 times a week.

## 1st week Review
I find it a hard way to let my friend foucs on what I'm talking about. It looks like so boring just as when I learned math. Thanks to Mr.Shizhong, one of my favorate professor, once teached "Computer Networking", impressed me. I'd like to use his way to finish this study.
